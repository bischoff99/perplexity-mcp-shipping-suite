Activates the auto-fixer agent to:

1. **Scan for Issues**: Identify bugs, security vulnerabilities, performance problems
2. **Fix Immediately**: Implement solutions without asking permission

4. **Provide Summary**: Brief report of what was fixed

The agent will use Edit/MultiEdit tools to make targeted improvements while preserving the original functionality.
